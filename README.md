# codmetric_task2
A simple and effective linear regression model that predicts median house prices in California based on demographic and geographic features from the California Housing dataset.
This project demonstrates core machine learning principles including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using scikit-learn, joblib, and streamlit.

Features:

Trains a linear regression model on the California Housing dataset
Scales data using StandardScaler for accurate regression output
Evaluates performance with Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score
Predicts house prices with safe clipping for negative values
Streamlit-based user interface for interactive predictions
Fully reproducible and minimalistic codebase

Tech Stack:

Python 
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
streamlit
